        <blockquote><p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. 
        They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up 
        that same day. Great service.</blockquote>

        an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. 
        I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.
